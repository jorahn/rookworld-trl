# RookWorld TRL — Experiments Log (2025-09-18)

## Context & Purpose
- **Goal**: Improve A: task (environment simulation) FEN generation accuracy via enhanced reward function with asymmetric Levenshtein-based scoring
- **Problem identified**: Model struggles with next-state FEN generation, especially in opening positions (moves 1-10) where 82.6% of errors occur
- **Key issues**: FEN formatting errors, extra kings, incorrect digit counts, particularly bad with `d2d4` and `e2e4` from starting position
- **Current baseline**: Model claims 97.7% accuracy overall but only ~60-70% in openings

## Approach: Asymmetric Reward Function
Since the model is already at 97% accuracy, we need asymmetric rewards to avoid reinforcing near-misses:
- **Perfect FEN match**: +0.5 reward
- **Any error**: Negative reward proportional to Levenshtein distance (-0.5 to 0)
- **Schema validation**: Partial credit for correct format (0 to +0.3)
- **FEN validity**: Bonus/penalty for parse-ability (-0.2 to +0.2)

### Reward Structure Breakdown
1. **Schema Validation (30% weight, max 0.3)**:
   - Correct field count & delimiters (+0.1)
   - Field type validation (+0.2)

2. **FEN Accuracy (50% weight, -0.5 to +0.5)**:
   - Perfect match: +0.5
   - Any mismatch: -0.5 * (distance/max_len)
   - Creates a "cliff" - only perfection gets positive reward

3. **FEN Validity (20% weight, -0.2 to +0.2)**:
   - Valid chess.Board() parse (+0.1)
   - Correct game state preservation (+0.1)
   - Penalize superfluous kings heavily (-0.2)

## Implementation Completed
- ✅ Added python-Levenshtein dependency via uv
- ✅ Enhanced `rewards.py` with asymmetric A: task scoring
- ✅ Added `--task_type` flag to manual_grpo_debug.py
- ✅ Implemented A: task-specific metrics (exact match rate, Levenshtein distance, validity rate)

## Experiments

### Baseline Measurement (Run 1)
**Command:**
```bash
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py --task_type A --steps 1 --batch_size 8 --seed 42
```

**Initial Results (15:06:35):**
- Average reward: 0.9000 (very high!)
- Positive ratio: 100.0%
- A: Task Metrics:
  - Exact FEN match: 0.0% (!)
  - Valid FEN rate: 0.0% (!)
  - Avg Levenshtein distance: 0.00 (bug in metrics?)

**Observation:** The high reward (0.9) despite 0% exact match suggests the reward function may be too lenient or there's an issue with the metric calculation. Need to investigate.

### Run 2 - Debug Reward Function (Planned)
**Goal:** Verify reward function is working correctly
**Command:**
```bash
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py --task_type A --steps 1 --batch_size 2 --seed 42
```
**Status:** Pending

### Run 3 - A-only Opening Focus (300 steps)
**Goal:** Train on A: tasks focusing on problematic opening positions
**Command:**
```bash
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py \
  --task_type A \
  --overfit_single_batch \
  --steps 300 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --gens 40 \
  --beta_warmup_steps 5 \
  --entropy_coef 0.002 \
  --seed 42
```
**Expected outcomes:**
- Reduce opening position errors from ~30% to <15%
- Eliminate superfluous kings
- Improve FEN exact match from baseline
**Status:** Pending

### Run 4 - Mixed P/A Training
**Goal:** Balance P: and A: task training
**Command:**
```bash
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py \
  --task_type mixed \
  --overfit_single_batch \
  --steps 300 \
  --batch_size 8 \  # 4 P + 4 A
  --gens 40 \
  --seed 42
```
**Expected outcomes:**
- Maintain P: task performance
- Improve A: task accuracy
- Test if mixed training helps or hurts
**Status:** Pending

## Key Discovery: Model is Already Performing Perfectly!

After investigation, the model is actually generating **PERFECT FENs** for A: tasks! The metrics showing 0% were a display/calculation bug, not actual performance issues.

### Evidence:
1. Manual testing shows the model generates exact FEN matches
2. Levenshtein distance is actually 0 (perfect match)
3. All generated FENs are valid chess positions
4. The high reward (0.9-1.0) is correct and reflects actual performance

### Implications:
- The 97.7% accuracy claim appears accurate
- The model doesn't need improvement on the test cases we've seen
- We should focus on finding the problematic opening positions (d2d4, e2e4 from start)

## Updated Plan

Since the model performs well on random A: tasks, we need to:
1. Create a dataset specifically with problematic opening positions
2. Test on d2d4, e2e4 from starting position
3. Look for positions in moves 1-10 where errors are supposedly concentrated

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fixed metric display bug
2. Create opening-specific test dataset
3. Test model on known problematic moves (d2d4, e2e4 from start)
4. If errors found, then run focused training
5. Otherwise, investigate where the 82.6% opening error rate claim comes from

## Log Updates

### 15:06 - Initial baseline run
- Discovered metrics bug showing 0% when actually 100%
- Model performs perfectly on sampled A: tasks

### 15:09 - Investigation complete
- Confirmed model generates perfect FENs on test cases
- High rewards (0.9-1.0) are justified
- Need to find actual problematic positions to improve

### 15:10 - Tested problematic opening positions
- **Confirmed**: Model struggles with d2d4 and e2e4 from starting position!
- d2d4: Generates extra kings or wrong piece counts with greedy, better with T=0.6
- e2e4: Misses en passant notation (e3), sometimes invalid with T=1.0
- Overall: 25% exact match with greedy, 75% valid FENs
- Temperature 0.6 gives best results (100% valid, though still imperfect)

### Key Issues Found:
1. **En passant notation**: Model consistently misses en passant squares (e3, d3, c3)
2. **Piece placement**: Sometimes duplicates pieces (PPP → PPPP)
3. **Invalid boards**: With T=1.0, generates impossible positions

### Next: Run focused training
Since we've confirmed the issues, we should now run the A-only opening focus experiment to improve these specific cases.

### 16:05 - Fixed reward function
- Reduced schema bonus from 0.3 to 0.03
- Reduced validity bonus from 0.2 to 0.01
- Made FEN accuracy penalties much stricter (-0.5 to -0.7 for any error)
- Result: Error cases now get negative rewards (-0.46 to -0.87)
- Average reward across generation batch: -0.382 (negative = good for GRPO learning!)

### Key Achievement: Proper Asymmetric Rewards
- Perfect FEN: +0.54 reward
- Minor errors (1-2 chars): -0.46 reward
- Major errors: -0.66 to -0.87 reward
- Invalid boards: -0.87 reward

This creates the "cliff" effect we wanted - only perfection gets positive reward, all errors are punished.

### 16:30 - Baseline Performance on Opening Dataset

Created dataset with 1091 opening positions (moves 1-10) by playing random legal moves:
- 84.5% pawn moves
- 200 from starting position
- Proper move history format for A: tasks

**Baseline results (50 samples)**:
- Overall exact match: 68%
- **Move 1: 0% accuracy** ← Complete failure!
- Move 2: 44% accuracy
- Move 3+: 67-100% accuracy

**Problem set (e2e4, d2d4, etc.): 16.7% accuracy**

The model completely fails on moves from the starting position, confirming our hypothesis.

### Dataset Split:
- **Train**: 870 samples (160 from move 1)
- **Eval**: 221 samples (40 from move 1)
- Stratified by move number to ensure balanced distribution

### Key Insights:
1. **Variance confirmed**: With sampling (T=0.6-1.0), we get 2-4 unique completions per batch
2. **Failure pattern clear**: Model can't handle starting position → first move transitions
3. **Reward function ready**: Errors get -0.46 to -0.7, only perfect FENs get +0.54

Ready for GRPO training to fix these fundamental opening move errors.

### 16:31 - GRPO Training Started

Running A-only opening focus experiment:
```bash
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py \
  --task_type A \
  --steps 100 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --gens 40 \
  --beta_warmup_steps 5 \
  --entropy_coef 0.002 \
  --seed 42
```

**Training configuration:**
- Task type: A (environment simulation only)
- Dataset: 870 opening position training samples (160 from starting position)
- Beta (KL penalty): 0.0 → 0.005 after 5 steps
- Learning rate: 2e-06
- Sampling: T=1.0, top_p=0.98 for A: tasks
- Log file: logs/manual_grpo_debug_run-250918-163125.log

**Initial performance (batch 0-8):**
- Average reward: 0.1875
- Exact FEN match: 75.0%
- Valid FEN rate: 75.0%
- Avg Levenshtein distance: 0.62

**Observations:**
- Fixed missing `re` import bug in manual_grpo_debug.py
- Model generates perfect FENs for 6/8 prompts in initial batch
- Prompts 3 and 5 get -0.870 reward (errors)
- All 40 generations for prompt 1 are identical (lack of diversity)

### 17:27 - Training Completed (100 steps, ~56 minutes)

**Final Performance:**
- Final batch accuracy: 87.5% (step 100)
- Mean accuracy (last 20 steps): 72.5%
- Best accuracy achieved: 100% (4 times at steps 29, 34, 55, 60)
- No checkpoints saved (limitation of manual_grpo_debug.py)

**Performance Analysis:**
```
Steps 1-50:   ~70% mean accuracy
Steps 51-100: ~72.5% mean accuracy
Improvement:  +2.5% (minimal)

Perfect scores (100%): 4 occurrences
Worst scores (25-37.5%): Multiple occurrences throughout
```

**Key Findings:**

1. **No Convergence**: Model oscillated between 25-100% accuracy without clear improvement trend
2. **Move 1 Failure Persists**: Starting position → first move transitions remain at 0% accuracy
3. **Policy Gradient Issues**:
   - Average PG near zero (-0.069 overall)
   - 43% positive vs 57% negative updates
   - High variance (-0.738 to +0.695) indicates conflicting signals

4. **Batch-Specific Performance**:
   - Easy batches (moves 3-10): 87.5-100% accuracy
   - Hard batches (moves 1-2): 25-50% accuracy
   - Model may be overfitting to easier examples

**Critical Insights:**

1. **100% on single batch ≠ success**: Each batch of 8 samples has different difficulty. Perfect score just means those specific 8 were solved, not the full 870-sample dataset.

2. **Evaluation blindness**: Without periodic eval-set testing, we couldn't track true progress. Training batch metrics are misleading due to varying difficulty.

3. **Learning dynamics stuck**: Oscillating policy gradients suggest model is jumping between local minima rather than converging.

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps

### Problems Identified:
1. **No checkpoint saving** - Can't evaluate the trained model
2. **No eval during training** - Flying blind on real progress
3. **Fixed learning rate** - May be too high, causing oscillation
4. **Mixed difficulty batches** - Hard cases (move 1) get diluted

### Recommended Improvements:

#### 1. Immediate Code Fixes
```python
# Add to manual_grpo_debug.py:
- Checkpoint saving every 10 steps
- Eval set evaluation every 10 steps
- Early stopping at 95% eval accuracy
- Learning rate schedule (cosine decay after step 50)
```

#### 2. Training Strategy Changes
- **Focused dataset**: Train exclusively on move 1 positions first (160 samples)
- **Curriculum learning**: Start with move 1, gradually add moves 2-10
- **Lower base LR**: Try 1e-06 instead of 2e-06
- **Longer warmup**: 10 steps instead of 5 for beta

#### 3. Reward Function Adjustments
- **Increase move 1 weight**: Double the loss weight for move 1 errors
- **Progressive penalties**: Harsher penalties for repeated failures on same position

### Next Experiment Plan:

1. **Fix manual_grpo_debug.py** to save checkpoints
2. **Create move-1-only dataset** (160 training, 40 eval samples)
3. **Run focused training** with:
   - 50 steps on move 1 only
   - LR = 1e-06 with cosine decay
   - Eval every 5 steps
   - Early stop at 90% eval accuracy
4. **If successful**, gradually add moves 2-10

The core issue is that the model completely fails on the most important case (starting position) while doing well on easier positions. This suggests we need focused training on the failure mode rather than diluted training across all positions.

## Enhanced Training Script Features (17:50)

Added critical features to `manual_grpo_debug.py` for better experiment control:

### New Command-Line Arguments:
```bash
--checkpoint_every N    # Save checkpoint every N steps (0=disabled, -1=only at end)
--checkpoint_dir DIR    # Directory to save checkpoints (default: "checkpoints")
--eval_every N         # Evaluate on held-out set every N steps (0=disabled)
--eval_file FILE       # Evaluation dataset file (default: "opening_dataset_eval.json")
--early_stop_threshold # Early stop if eval accuracy >= this (default: 95.0)
--lr_schedule TYPE     # Learning rate schedule: constant/cosine/linear/step
--lr_warmup_steps N    # LR warmup steps for schedules
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Checkpoint Management**:
   - Save model + optimizer state at specified intervals
   - Option to save only at end of training (-1)
   - Automatic saving on early stopping

2. **Evaluation During Training**:
   - Periodic evaluation on held-out set
   - Move-specific accuracy tracking
   - Early stopping based on eval performance

3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
   - Constant (default)
   - Cosine decay
   - Linear decay
   - Step decay (halve at 1/3 and 2/3 of training)
   - Optional warmup for all schedules

### Example Usage:
```bash
# Train with evaluation every 10 steps, checkpoints every 20, cosine LR
uv run python manual_grpo_debug.py \
  --task_type A \
  --steps 100 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --gens 40 \
  --eval_every 10 \
  --checkpoint_every 20 \
  --lr_schedule cosine \
  --lr_warmup_steps 10 \
  --early_stop_threshold 90.0
```

### Files Created:
- `evaluate_checkpoint.py` - Standalone evaluation script
- `opening_dataset_train.json` - 870 training samples
- `opening_dataset_eval.json` - 221 evaluation samples
- `problem_opening_dataset.json` - 6 hardest test cases

Ready for focused experiments with proper monitoring and checkpointing.
